Smart helmet

This code uses slack and push bullet applications to communicate with the raspberry pi device.
A command is given to the device using slack as  "@mybot turn helmeton"
The camera that is fixed on the helmet starts to record as soon as the Record mode is turned on.
The video that is recorded is stored in a secondary memory,which can be used for later reference.
